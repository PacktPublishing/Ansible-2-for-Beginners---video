## About the Video Course
Ansible is one of the most popular tools in the open source
orchestration and automation space. This simple, agent-less tool can
conquer almost any automation task. Whether you want to manage an entire
cloud region, configure network devices, or orchestrate configuration
changes across Linux or Windows machines, Ansible is up to the challenge.

In this course, you will get started with Ansible 2.0, including its
installation, the problems it solves, and more. We will also walk
through creating your very first playbooks. You’ll understand the power
of variables and quickly be able to manage environments and implement
strategies. You will find out how to integrate with different cloud
platforms and be introduced to Ansible Galaxy and Tower, which are
Ansible's enterprise tooling for supporting large-scale infrastructure.

By the end of this course, you will be well versed in the basics of
Ansible and be able to automate your organizational infrastructure easily.
